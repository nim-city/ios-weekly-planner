\f0\fs36 \cf0 All Tasks\
- Show modals when delete pressed on weekly breakdown, weekly overview, and lists screens\
- Weekly breakdown slide animation (will have to update to xcode 15 and use scrollTargetBehavior)\
- Apply colour scheme\
- Improve add item view scrolling ux (fine for now but could be better)\
- Edit mode toggle and update corresponding list views \
- Figure out what to do about notes\
\
Ideas\
- What do we do with notes?\
- Perhaps have specific work or workout items?\
- Maybe have to move to model where each item saved is a separate Task (rather than a relationship) so that users can write specific notes about each Task for each day?}
